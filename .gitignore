The modified files (`js/main.js`, `pages.md`, `styles/main.css`, `templates/footer.html`) are all source code and configuration files. There are no build artifacts, dependencies, temporary files, or other items that need to be ignored based on the provided change list.

Since the changes consist only of source/config files and no build artifacts or dependencies, no additional ignore rules are needed.
