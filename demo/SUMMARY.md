# Demo Section Summary

## Overview
We have successfully created a demo section for experimenting with new features, with the first experiment being a modern header menu implementation. This section allows us to test new functionality before implementing on the main site.

- Created `js/modern-menu.js` with enhanced functionality
- Implemented the menu in `index.html`
- Created `templates/modern-base.html` for potential backend integration

### 3. Documentation
- `README.md` - Main documentation for the demo section
- `MENU_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Detailed recommendations and implementation notes
- `SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
